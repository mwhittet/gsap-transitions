This small experimental project was bootstrapped using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so that I could quickly use [Greensock (GSAP)](https://greensock.com/gsap/) animations for a nice page transition effect along with SASS, React (of course) and React Router.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.
